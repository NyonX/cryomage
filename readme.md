Cryomage

About
A Discord moderation and talk bot developed by Aria Fong.
Cryomage is built on Discord.JS.

System Requirements
To run her, you'll need Node.JS v.81, Python, and Discord.JS installed in your system.
Cryo is very lightweight; it will not take much machine power for her to run.

Development
I started developing Cryo on June 29, 2017.
It wasn't until July 13, 2017 that Cryo became stable at v1.0.
5 days later, on July 18, I released v2.0 where I used guidebot's command handler for Cryo.
